first approach pertains to absolute poverty while the second method is the notion of 
relative poverty. The notion of absolute poverty pertains to the consumption 
expenditure considering a specified minimum standard. According to this method,
all individuals whose consumption expenditure is below a specific standard are 
classified as poor. While the relative concept of poverty refers to a state when the 
level of income or consumption expenditure of a family or an individual falls below 
a predetermined level. The distribution of income of different fractile groups is 
estimated and a comparison is also carried out between the standard of living of 
people in both bottom and the top layer of the population in order to evaluate a 
relative standard of poverty. Therefore, a relative definition of poverty is more 
applicable for developed nations in contrast to the absolute notion of poverty which 
is more prevalent in case of developing nations. 
The estimation of poverty is carried out by Planning Commission, the nodal agency 
of Government of India which estimates, the incidence of poverty at the national
level and state level separately for urban and rural areas. The methodology was 
recommended by Expert Group chaired by Prof. D.T. Lakdawala, Dr. Tendulkar,
and Dr. C. Rangarajan etc. According to the definition suggested by the expert 
group, the incidence of poverty is measured by poverty ratio. Poverty ratio is 
defined as a number of poor to the total population expressed as a percentage. This 
is also referred as headcount ratio. The poverty line which is quantified as per capita 
consumption expenditure over a month along with class distribution is used to 
define poverty ratio as prescribed in the survey of National Sample Survey Office
